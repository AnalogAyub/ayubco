        <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
        <p class="dropcap">The ultimate ingredient is stardust — mine is made up of bits and pixels. With these tools, I guide <em>identities, experiences, and narratives</em> from idea to fruition to promotion.</p>
        <p>Diversity is essential, so I value the importance of visiting every universe of design. I worked on my first real brand to grow a local business when I was 13. Since then, I've flirted with everything from video production and art catalogues to pitch decks and mobile apps, and most recently, web design and development.</p>
        <p>Slowly, I've learned to appreciate both breadth and depth in effective design. For each new project, I think about the overarching strategy and the implicit user experience before placing a pixel or writing a line of code.</p>
        <p>As a business student in <a href="http://jindal.utdallas.edu/undergraduate-programs/honors-program/">a lovely cohort</a>, I’m learning more about how to convert ideas into business endeavours and build striking brands along the way. Offscreen, I may be <a href="/exposures">shooting film</a> or reading theoretical physics.</p>

        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>Curated here is a collection of diverse and thorough work. I've had the pleasure of working on these designs for startups, non-profits, school work, and side projects. If you could use a hand growing your business or organisation through design, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:bilal@ayub.co?subject=Bilal, help me grow my brand">let me know</a>. I'm always open to inquires to craft delight.</p>
