        <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
        <p class="dropcap">Working somewhere between design and business development, I guide startups and organisations from idea to fruition to promotion. How? By breathing life into your brand with *bits, pixels, and a little strategy.</p>
        <p>Your brand is precious. Having worked with nonprofits, developers, and managers, I respect your manifesto, performance, and strategic goals. By working <em>with</em> your team, I can use design to position your message for both users <em>and</em> investors.</p>
        <p>I worked on my first real brand to successfully advance a local business when I was 13. Since then, I’ve been exposed to everything from video production and art catalogues to pitch decks and mobile apps — and most enjoyably — web design and development.</p>
        <p>Slowly, I’ve learned to appreciate both breadth and depth in effective design. For each new project, I think about the overarching strategy and the implicit user experience before placing a pixel or writing a line of code. As part of a <a href="http://jindal.utdallas.edu/undergraduate-programs/honors-program/">lovely cohort</a>, I’m also learning how convert ideas into valuable business endeavours.</p>
