        <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
        <p class="dropcap">I breathe life into your brand with *bits, pixels, and a little strategy. Working somewhere between design and business development, I guide startups and organisations from idea to fruition to promotion.</p>
        <p>Your brand is precious and there’s an incredible amount of work that goes into crafting its marvel — so I value all the universes that go into your project. Having worked with nonprofits, developers, and managers, I respect your manifesto, performance, and strategic goals. By working <em>with</em> your team, I can use design to position your message for both users <em>and</em> investors.</p>
        <p>I worked on my first real brand to grow a local business when I was 13. Since then, I’ve flirted with everything from video production and art catalogues to pitch decks and mobile apps, and most recently, web design and development.</p>
        <p>Slowly, I’ve learned to appreciate both breadth and depth in effective design. For each new project, I think about the overarching strategy and the implicit user experience before placing a pixel or writing a line of code.</p>
