Personal portfolio site made with magic.

So far, I've got a working header with working animations, and nicely calibrated typesetting. Still working on the rest of the design, of course, so fonts served by Typekit are highly unoptimised â€” serving everything at over 800k. I'll sort that out later once I settle on which weights I'm actually using, then serve a smaller kit without ligatures for mobile.
