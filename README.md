Personal portfolio site.

# TODO
- I'd like to parallax the bg image if I can avoid killing performance
- Remove giant gradient to improve performance (seems to only affect chrome desktop)
- Curate works (aka actual portfolio content)
- Photography site
- Blog via Ghost

# Layout

### Header

> “I create and grow identities, experiences, and narratives with baryon-fed, cage-free stardust*”

### Nav
- Work (index)
- Exposures
- Writing

### Work [(reference)](http://jim-silverman.com/)
- Grid of case studies mixed with dribbble-esque individual shots
- Should “shots” link to blog? … probably, easier than making individual case study pages
- Case studies should include challenges/solutions/scope per project [(reference)](http://braveux.com/work/stateofobesity)

### Fundamentals
- CV Education/Experience on sidebar, collapses underneath on mobile

### Footer [(reference)](http://daneden.me/)
- Contact: email/twitter
- Presently: reading/listening
- Availability
